## 🔍 Understanding the Confidence System

### The Algorithm
```python
confidence = 100 * (1 - min(variance / threshold, 1.0))
```

### What It Means
- **High Confidence (75-100%)**: Stable player, good matchup
- **Medium Confidence (60-74%)**: Some variance, decent bet
- **Low Confidence (<60%)**: High variance, verify manually

### Visual Indicators
- **Green Border**: Good to go (≥60%)
- **Orange Border**: Double-check this (<60%)

### When Orange Appears
- Rookie or backup player
- Limited recent games
- Elite opposing defense
- Injury concerns
- Weather factors

### What To Do
1. Click **ℹ️ Data Sources**
2. Follow the links provided
3. Manually verify the player's status
4. Decide if you trust it
5. Orange ≠ bad, just means "be cautious"

## 🎤 Tony Romo Narrative System

### How It Works
```
1. Analyze game spread → Identify favorite
2. Check game total → Shootout vs. defensive battle
3. Review player predictions → Pass-heavy vs. run-heavy
4. Calculate consensus confidence → Narrative confidence
5. Generate enthusiastic commentary → Tony Romo style
```

### Example Outputs

**Shootout Game (Total: 55.5)**
> "This is gonna be a shootout! Both offenses are clicking, and I wouldn't 
> be surprised if we see 60+ points on the board. Unbelievable!"

**Defensive Battle (Total: 38.5)**
> "This is gonna be a defensive slugfest. Low-scoring, grind-it-out 
> football. These defenses are legit, Jim!"

**Blowout Prediction (Spread: -10.5)**
> "Now here's the thing - Chiefs are laying more than a touchdown here, 
> and I love it! This is gonna be a statement game!"
